# Geometa
Multiplayer game where you form shapes with teammates to grant bonuses to defeat the enemy team

# Rules
Players are spit into 2 teams. Each team has their own base and flag. A team wins the game when they steal the enemy flag and bring it to their base.

Players can shoot their opponents to send them back to their base with a respawn timer, giving them an advantage in proceeding further into the map.

To avoid a draw, respawns timers gradually increase.

Players can form shapes to activate certain buffs:

 - Solo: +speed
 - Line: ++speed +vision
 - Triangle: +resistance -speed
 - Rectangle: +damage -speed
 - Pentagon: +damage +spread -movement
 - After they get killed players respawn after a 10s cooldown.

Once carrying the flag you cannot join a shape/activate a buff.

Players can ping a shape on the map, teammates can join the vertices of the shape and become 'docked'.
The player that began the shape now controls their teammates' (who are on the shape) movements.
Players can leave the shape whenever they want.

Players all have a health bar that gradually regains health out of combat, there will also be health packs on the map
