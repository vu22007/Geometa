# Geometa
Multiplayer game where you form shapes with teammates to grant bonuses to defeat the enemy team

# Gameplay & Rules
Players are spit into 2 teams. Each team has their own base and flag. A team wins the game when they steal the enemy flag and bring it to their base.

Players can shoot their opponents to send them back to their base with a respawn timer, giving them an advantage in proceeding further into the map.

## Shapes & Buffs
Players can form shapes to activate certain buffs:

 - Line: +speed +vision
 - Triangle: +resistance
 - Rectangle: +damage 
 - Pentagon: +damage +spread -speed

Once carrying the flag you cannot join a shape/activate a buff.

## How to make a shape
Players will collect points through killing opponents and collecting from pickup points around the map

These points are spent on shapes/buffs. A player will use a number of points to 'ping' a shape to their team. 

The shape will gradually disappear over 5 seconds unless a teammate comes in contact with it, the countdown resets and shortens everytime a player moves off the shape.

Once all the vertices of the shape have a teamate on it, the shape will begin a countdown during which the players must not move off their vertex.

Once the timer is complete, the players will receive the associated buff for a designated amount of time.

## Health & Respawns
Players all have a health bar that gradually regains health out of combat, there will also be health packs on the map.

After dying players will respawn after a period of time.

To avoid a draw, the timer gradually increase.
